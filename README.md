Description:

This project tackles the challenging task of identifying fake accounts on Instagram. It leverages the robust and accurate Random Forest classification algorithm to analyze various profile features and distinguish between genuine and inauthentic accounts. By effectively handling complex datasets, the model aims to contribute to a safer and more reliable Instagram experience.

Features:

Data Acquisition:

Obtaining data for this project requires careful consideration of ethical implications. Here are two potential approaches:

Publicly Available Datasets: If you choose to use publicly available Instagram profile data, ensure the dataset adheres to Instagram's terms of service and respects user privacy.

Manual Data Collection: If you opt for manual data collection, obtain explicit consent from users before collecting any profile information.

Feature Engineering:

We'll extract the following informative features from the collected data to train the model:

Account age
Number of posts, followers, and following
Post frequency
Engagement metrics (likes, comments)
Textual analysis of bios and captions (optional)
Image features (optional, using OpenCV for analysis)
Random Forest Classifier:

This project employs the Random Forest classifier, an ensemble learning method. It combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and effectively handle overfitting.

The Random Forest's strength lies in its ability to learn from complex, high-dimensional data, making it a well-suited choice for analyzing diverse Instagram profile attributes.

Evaluation:

To assess the model's performance, we'll utilize the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: Proportion of true positives among identified positives.
Recall: Proportion of identified positives that are actually true positives.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
